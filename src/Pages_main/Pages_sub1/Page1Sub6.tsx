        <h1>Kirindi Ella Waterfall</h1>

        <p>The source of this breath-taking, 116m-high fall is the Kirindi Ella (stream), which flows from its starting point 940m up the Kuttapitiya Mountain.
           The stream travels 13km before the cascading point in the Kaluwaramukalana Jungle.
            It then flows via the Denawaka River to the Kaluganga River, located in the Bambarakotuwa Jungle. Local villagers say that there is a picture of a tortoise etched into stone here.</p>
