        <h1>Ridi Viharaya</h1>
        <p>
          Nestled in the scenic hills of Kurunegala, Ridi Viharaya (Silver
          Temple) is a centuries-old Buddhist temple with a rich history. Known
          for its intricate rock carvings, stunning murals, and serene
          atmosphere, the temple is a treasure trove of cultural and spiritual
          significance. The name "Ridi" means silver, referring to the silver
          ore discovered nearby, which financed the construction of the
          magnificent Aluvihare Temple. Visitors can explore ancient relics,
          marvel at unique architecture, and enjoy peaceful surroundings, making
          it a must-visit for history enthusiasts and spiritual seekers alike.
