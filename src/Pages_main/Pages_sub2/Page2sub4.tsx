        <p>
          Yapahuwa is an ancient fortress and royal city located in Sri Lanka’s
          North Western Province, offering travelers a glimpse into the island’s
          rich history. Built in the 13th century, Yapahuwa served as the
          capital of Sri Lanka during the reign of King Bhuvanekabahu I. The
          highlight of this site is the impressive stone stairway that leads to
          the ruins of a once magnificent palace, with intricately carved
          stonework showcasing the architectural grandeur of the period. At the
          top, visitors are rewarded with stunning views of the surrounding
          plains. Yapahuwa is a must-visit for history buffs and those
          interested in exploring Sri Lanka’s ancient capitals and royal
          heritage.
