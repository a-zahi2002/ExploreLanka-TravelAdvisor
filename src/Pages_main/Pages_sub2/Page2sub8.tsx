        <p>
          St. Anne's National Shrine, located in Talawila on the western coast
          of Sri Lanka, is one of the country’s most significant Christian
          pilgrimage sites. With a history dating back to the 18th century, the
          shrine is dedicated to St. Anne, the mother of the Virgin Mary, and
          attracts thousands of devotees each year, especially during its annual
          feast in July and August. The church’s beautiful location near the
          beach adds to its serene atmosphere, making it a peaceful retreat for
          prayer and reflection. Visitors to the shrine can experience the
          spiritual heritage of Sri Lanka’s Catholic community and participate
          in its vibrant religious traditions.
