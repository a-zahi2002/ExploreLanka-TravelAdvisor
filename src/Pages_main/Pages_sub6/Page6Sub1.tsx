        <h1>Nine Arches Railway Bridge</h1>
        <p>The Nine Arches Railway Bridge, also known as the Demodara Bridge, is an iconic structure in the Ella region of Sri Lanka. Built in the early 20th century, 
          it features nine stunning stone arches that span a deep ravine, connecting the towns of Demodara and Ella.
          This British colonial engineering marvel supports the railway line between Colombo and Badulla and is crafted from locally quarried stones that blend with the surrounding landscapes.
          Set amidst lush tea plantations and forests, 
          the bridge offers breathtaking views of the Ella Gap, attracting tourists, photographers, and railway enthusiasts.
          Visitors often walk along the tracks to capture the scenic beauty of the bridge. Despite its age, it remains a vital transportation link in Sri Lankaâ€™s hill country,
          showcasing the enduring legacy of colonial engineering and the island's natural beauty.</p>
