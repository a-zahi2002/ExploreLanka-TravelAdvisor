        <h1>Elephant Rock</h1>
        <p>
          Just a short distance from Arugam Bay, Elephant Rock is a scenic and
          relatively secluded beach offering stunning panoramic views and a
          peaceful atmosphere. The area gets its name from the massive rock
          formation resembling an elephant that dominates the landscape. While
          Elephant Rock is a popular surfing spot, especially for beginners due
          to its smaller waves compared to Arugam Bay, it also attracts nature
          lovers for its quiet charm. The beach is often less crowded, providing
          a perfect place to relax, hike, or take in the area's natural beauty.
          The rock formation is also home to a variety of wildlife, including
          monkeys, birds, and reptiles, which can be spotted on guided tours.
          The nearby Kumana National Park offers opportunities for birdwatching
          and wildlife spotting, making Elephant Rock a great base for exploring
          the surrounding natural beauty. In the evenings, visitors can enjoy
          the local seafood and traditional Sri Lankan cuisine at one of the
          many restaurants in the area. The rock's relaxed atmosphere and
          stunning natural beauty make it an ideal destination for those seeking
          a peaceful and adventurous getaway.
