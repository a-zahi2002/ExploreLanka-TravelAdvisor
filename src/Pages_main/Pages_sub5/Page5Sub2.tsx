        <h1>Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi</h1>
        <p>
          The Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi is no ordinary tree; it is the oldest
          human-planted tree in the world with a known planting date, grown from
          a cutting of the sacred Bodhi tree in India under which Buddha
          attained enlightenment. Planted in 288 B.C., this sacred fig tree
          stands as one of the most important pilgrimage destinations in Sri
          Lanka. The sacred precinct surrounding the tree offers a peaceful and
          spiritual atmosphere where devotees pray and make offerings. Visiting
          Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi offers not only a spiritual journey but also a
          connection to Sri Lankaâ€™s ancient history. The site is part of the
          larger Mahamewna Gardens, which boasts archaeological ruins and a
          calm, reflective ambiance. Tourists will be drawn to the serenity of
          the site, along with the vibrant cultural practices that take place
          regularly, such as processions, prayers, and offerings.
