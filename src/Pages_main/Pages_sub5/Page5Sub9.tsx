          The Thuparama Dagaba is a historic stupa located in the ancient city
          of Anuradhapura, built by King Devanampiya Tissa in the 3rd century
          B.C. This stupa is said to contain a relic of the Buddha, making it a
          sacred site for Buddhists. The stupa is surrounded by a complex of
          ruins, including ancient temples and monasteries, offering a glimpse
          into the lives of the monks and devotees who once inhabited the area.
