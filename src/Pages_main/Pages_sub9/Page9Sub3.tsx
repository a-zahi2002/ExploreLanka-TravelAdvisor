            Viharamahadevi Park, the largest and oldest park in Colombo, is a lush, green oasis in the heart of the city. Originally named "Victoria Park" during British colonial rule, it was later renamed after Queen Viharamahadevi, a famous historical figure in Sri Lanka. The park is a favorite spot for both locals and tourists, offering well-maintained gardens, shaded walkways, and peaceful spots to relax amidst nature.<br />The park is home to a variety of flora and fauna, including beautiful flowering trees, fountains, and statues. One of its prominent features is the massive golden Buddha statue that overlooks the park, adding a spiritual touch to its calm environment. There are also playgrounds for children, a small zoo, and seasonal flower shows, making it a family-friendly destination.
