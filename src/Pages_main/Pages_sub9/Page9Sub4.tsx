          Established in 1877, the Colombo National Museum is a treasure trove
          of Sri Lankan history and culture. The museum's grand colonial
          building houses an extensive collection of artifacts, including
          ancient and medieval period bronzes, sculptures, and paintings. The
          museum also showcases regalia belonging to the Kandyan kings, along
          with a vast array of historical manuscripts and local crafts,
          providing a comprehensive overview of the island's rich heritage.
