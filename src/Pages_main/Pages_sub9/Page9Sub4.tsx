            The Colombo National Museum, also known as the Sri Lanka National Museum, is the largest and most significant museum in the country. Established in 1877 by Sir William Henry Gregory, the then British Governor of Ceylon, this grand building is a treasure trove of Sri Lankan history, culture, and heritage. The museum's colonial-era architecture is as impressive as the artifacts housed within, including ancient statues, royal regalia, weapons, traditional artwork, and historical documents.<br />The Colombo National Museum, also known as the Sri Lanka National Museum, is the largest and most significant museum in the country.
