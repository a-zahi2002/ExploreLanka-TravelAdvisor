        <p>
          The Galle Face Green is one of the more popular places in the
          commercial capital that allows you to take a break from the urban
          jungle. Moreover, the wide green space also allows you to engage in
          some recreational activities from flying kites to playing cricket.
          Couple that with the exquisite street food on offer along the coast
          and it becomes the perfect place to relax before heading back to Lake
          Lodge for the night.
