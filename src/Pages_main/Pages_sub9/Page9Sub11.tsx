          The Dutch Hospital Shopping Precinct in Colombo, Sri Lanka, is a
          transformed heritage building that was converted into a shopping and
          dining area in 2011 by the Urban Development Authority. It retains its
          historical architecture and features a variety of shops, primarily
          restaurants and cafes, including popular places like the Ministry of
          Crab.
