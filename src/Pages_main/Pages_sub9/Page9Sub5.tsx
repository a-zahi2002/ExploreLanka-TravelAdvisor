        <h1>Independence Memorial Hall</h1>
        <p>
          Located in Independence Square, this monument was built to commemorate
          Sri Lanka's independence from British rule in 1948. The structure is
          modeled after the Magul Maduwa (Celebration Hall) in Kandy and
          features traditional Sri Lankan architecture. The hall is surrounded
          by lush gardens and a reflecting pool, providing a peaceful
          atmosphere. Inside, there's a museum dedicated to the independence
          struggle, with exhibits highlighting the country's journey to freedom.
