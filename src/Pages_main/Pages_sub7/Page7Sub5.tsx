        <p>Kankesanthurai, located in the Jaffna Peninsula of Sri Lanka, is a coastal town known for its stunning beaches and historical significance. Once a thriving port during colonial times, Kankesanthurai is home to the remains of an old railway station and the Kankesanthurai Harbour, which has been a vital shipping point. The area is also notable for the nearby Kankesanthurai Lighthouse, which offers beautiful views of the coastline. The serene beaches, combined with opportunities for swimming and fishing, make it a popular destination for both locals and tourists.
