      The Jaffna Public Library, established in 1931 in Jaffna, Sri Lanka, is a historically significant institution known for its vast collection of Tamil literature and manuscripts, with over 97,000 volumes at its peak. Notable for its Indo-Saracenic architectural style, the library became a symbol of Tamil identity and scholarship until it was tragically destroyed in a fire in 1981 during civil unrest. After extensive efforts, it was rebuilt and reopened in 2003, retaining its cultural essence while modernizing its facilities. Today, the library continues to promote literacy and education, hosting various cultural events and workshops, serving as a vital resource for the local community and a symbol of resilience and cultural revival in Jaffna.
