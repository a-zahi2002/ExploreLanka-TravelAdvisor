        Heritage Site. The province also includes the popular tourist
        destinations of Nuwara Eliya, known for its colonial charm, and Matale,
        famous for spice gardens. The region's rich cultural heritage, scenic
        beauty, and biodiversity make it a significant part of Sri Lankaâ€™s
